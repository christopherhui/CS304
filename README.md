# Job-4-Me
### What is Job-4-Me
A project from CPSC 304- Introduction to Relational Databases that uses Oracle JDBC and Spring for creating and handling different job applications for employeers and job seekers. We created a website that simulates the ability to both find and search for jobs with ease, and the ability for employeers to track and filter applicants they desire, and job seekers to filter jobs that they desire.
